				<backstory>After getting all of the water from the newly found inhabitable planet "Evaohn" you are returning back to Earth to report the good news to everyone, when suddenly out of nowhere a fearsome space storm hits you and traps you inside. You now are fighting to try and survive the storm dodging all of the electric currents, in order to return to Earth with the news.

				<blog>OBJECTIVE: Steer the ship dodging all of the debris("electric currents") ensuring that they do not hit you and take all three of your lives. Easier said then done when the currents reset and get larger every 15 seconds! There is still hope though as the top and bottom edges of the screen are temporary safezones for when the debris resets and grows larger.</blog>
