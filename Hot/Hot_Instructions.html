				<backstory>A few hours into your journey into space you discovered a <large>HUGE</large> issue! You and the team on Earth forgot to pack water! After flying for days, you lucked out and came accross a planet with an atmosphere, with traces of water to be found in it. However, it is extremly HOT. Your new priority is to fly through the atmosphere and try to collect as much water as you can for your journey back to Earth before the ship over heats.
